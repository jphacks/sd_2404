# Project Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, please ensure that the following are installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (required for front-end development)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (required for back-end server)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to start both the backend and frontend servers:

### Set Up and Start the Backend
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory. Replace `/path/to/back-end` with the actual path where your backend is stored:
    - ` cd /path/to/back-end`
2. Activate the Python virtual environment (ensure the virtual environment is set up in advance):
    - On Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Run the backend server:
    - `python main.py`

### Set Up and Start the Frontend
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory. Replace `/path/to/front-end` with the actual path where your frontend is stored:
    - `cd /path/to/front-end`
2. Run the frontend development server:
    - `npm run dev`

### Access the Project
Once both servers are running:
- Open your browser and go to the address displayed in the terminal for the frontend server, usually in the format http://localhost:xxxx. The actual port (xxxx) will be shown in the terminal output.
